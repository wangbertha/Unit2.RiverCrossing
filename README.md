# Guided Practice - River Crossing

> A farmer is trying to get a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across the river...

Maybe you've heard of a similar river crossing puzzle before? This guided practice has you building a much simpler version - the goal is to get all the sheep from one river bank to the other. How do you do it? By clicking on the sheep!

Before you start, take a look at the existing code. A lot has already been built for you so that you can focus on practicing working with events.

## Prompts

The answers can be viewed directly below the respective prompt. The `solution` branch contains the final code.

1. There's a form to add sheep to the page, but it currently doesn't do anything! Add an event listener to the form so that when it's submitted, the state of the starting bank is updated to include additional sheep according to the user input. Remember to rerender!

   ```js
   const form = document.querySelector("form");
   form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();

     const numberInput = document.querySelector("#numSheep");
     for (let i = 0; i < numberInput.value; i++) {
       state.start.push("sheep");
     }

     render();
   });
   ```

   </details>

2. Complete `moveSheep`. Then, while rendering the sheep on the starting bank, add an event listener to the created button that will move the sheep in state and rerender.

   ```js
   function moveSheep() {
     const sheep = state.start.pop();
     state.target.push(sheep);
   }

   function renderStartSheep() {
     // ...
     button.addEventListener("click", () => {
       moveSheep();
       render();
     });
     // ...
   }
   ```

     </details>

3. Complete `renderTargetSheep` so that sheep on the target bank are rendered as well.

   <details>
   <summary>Show Answer</summary>

   ```js
   function renderTargetSheep() {
     const targetSheep = state.target.map((sheep) => {
       const li = document.createElement("li");
       li.textContent = "üêë";
       return li;
     });
     const targetBank = document.querySelector("#targetBank ul");
     targetBank.replaceChildren(...targetSheep);
   }
   ```

   </details>

## Extensions

If you're done early, try to implement one or more of the following features:

- Show visitors a congratulatory message when all sheep have been moved to the target bank.
- Add an intermediate step so sheep must be moved from the starting bank to the river before being moved to the target bank.
- Display to visitors many sheep have been moved to the target bank.
- Add a limit to how many sheep can be on the starting bank.
